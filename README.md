The Awesome Pet Directory app is a basic application that allows users to login and search multiple databases for information about pets. Users can add information about themselves and their pets which will be recorded in a PostgreSQL Database and can then be retrieved using a search bar. There is also a search function to retrieve information from a separate MongoDB which contains facts and picture urls for multiple animals.

The code from this app could be transferred to multiple different uses, such as a business directory, etc.

Data Sources:
 
Animal facts have been gathered for the MongoDB from GitHub repository found at:
- https://github.com/DucNgn/Dog-facts-API-DEPRECATED-.git
- https://gist.github.com/aetheryx/0ec1e3bb0b370a075d2080c6f673d294

All cat image Url were found at theCatAPI
All dog image url were found at theDogAPI

Postgres data was generated using mockaroo.com, or added using the UI
